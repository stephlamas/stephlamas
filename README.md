# ðŸš€ About me

My name is EstefanÃ­a, and I'm a Frontend Developer & translator!

Since I finished the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Madrid in 2022, and started a new career working as a Frontend Dev, my life has only gotten better.
I learned the MERN Stack => React | Javascript(ES6) | Node | Express | MongoDB | HTML | CSS.
